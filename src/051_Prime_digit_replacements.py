# By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that 6 of the 9 possible values are primes:
# 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83
#
# By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the 1st example having 7
# primes among the 10 generated numbers, yielding the family:
# 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993.
# Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.
#
# Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit,
# is part of an eight prime value family.
